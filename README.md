# Marvel Classifier

This a Deep Learning project to classify some of the most well-known characters from the Marvel Universe. There are eight classes to classify (Captain America, Iron man, Black Widow, Thanos, Loki, Doctor Strange, Hulk and Spider man). Although the repository contains the whole dataset, you can visit it through [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/hchen13/marvel-heroes "Kaggle").

The whole net is trained with a MobileNet achieving +93% accuracy on test. However, you can use any other pretrained official neural network from Keras.
